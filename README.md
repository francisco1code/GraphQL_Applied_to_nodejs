# GraphQL  ![](./images/1.png)

* What is GraphQL - is a  query  language for [API](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api), GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

* How to Works - A GraphQL service is created by defining types and fields on those types, then providing functions for each field on each type. Once a GraphQL service is running (typically at a URL on a web service), it can receive GraphQL queries to validate and execute. A received query is first checked to ensure it only refers to the types and fields defined, then runs the provided functions to produce a result.
